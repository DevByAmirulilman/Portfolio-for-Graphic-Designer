The website would be centred around the journey of the companyand any updates or promotions that the company is making.The client had askedthat they will not be accepting any bookings through the platform as the company already established a working bookings system through whatsapp. So instead, the platform will drive any customers that are surveying the company on the website to thewhatsapp number. The design of the website was kept simple but engaging through the clickable materials that was placed inside the platform. The style guide of the website was approved first by the Manager of the company and later on was translated to the website.',
